Method and Frequency of Class:
Lectures – Two lectures per week for 10 weeks. Each lecture will last 1.5 hours.
Lectures will provide an overview of the major themes related to a particular topic. You are encouraged to take notes as you listen to the delivery of the subject matter. You should not aim to write down every word spoken but should focus on key concepts and relevant examples discussed in the lectures. Also, make notes on the key areas for further reading recommended. It is more important to understand the subject content than to have a complete set of notes, which you do not understand.
Workshops – Six workshops throughout the semester. Each workshop will be an hour.
Workshops involve independent study/research followed by a group discussion during seminar classes. Workshops questions may be given to students in advance of the class. In a university, learning does not just occur in class (lecture and seminars). Therefore, students are expected to research a subject outside the timetabled contact hours. It is essential to do research before attempting workshop questions which require application and analysis of the subject matter. This presumes that the student has a good understanding of the topic to be discussed.
